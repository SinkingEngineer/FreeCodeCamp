	    <h2>Timeline of his life</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>1572</strong> Born in Alkmaar, Holland in an anabaptist family</li>
						<li><strong>1587</strong> Attended the Academy in Haarlem, also located in North Holland.Teachers at the Academy were Hendrik Goltzius, engraver, painter, alchemist and humanist, Karel van Mander, painter, writer, humanist and Cornelis Corneliszoon of Haarlem. Drebbel became a skilled engraver on copperplate and also took an interest in alchemy.</li>
						<li><strong>1595</strong> Married Sophia Jansdochter Goltzius, younger sister of Hendrick, and settled at Alkmaar. They had at least six children, of whom four survived. Drebbel worked initially as a painter, engraver and cartographer. But he was in constant need of money because of the prodigal lifestyle of his wife.</li>
						<li><strong>1598</strong> Obtained a patent for a water-supply system and a sort of perpetual clockwork.</li>
						<li><strong>1600</strong> Drebbel was in Middelburg where he built a fountain at the Noorderpoort. In that spectacle making center he may have picked up knowledge in the art of lens grinding and later would construct a magic lantern and a camera obscura.</li>
						<li><strong>1604</strong> The Drebbel family moved to England, probably at the invitation of the new king, James I of England (VI of Scotland). He was accommodated at Eltham Palace. Drebbel worked there at the masques, that were performed by and for the court. He was attached to the court of young Renaissance crown-prince Henry. He astonished the court with his inventions (a perpetuum mobile, automatic and hydraulic organs) and his optical instruments.</li>
						<li><strong>1610</strong> Drebbel and his family moved to Prague on invitation of Emperor Rudolf II, who was preoccupied with the arts, alchemy and occult sciences. Here again Drebbel demonstrated his inventions. </li>
						<li><strong>1611</strong> When Rudolf II was stripped of all effective power by his younger brother Archduke Matthias, Drebbel was imprisoned for about a year.</li>
						<li><strong>1612</strong> Drebbel was set free and went back to London. Unfortunately his patron prince Henry had also died and Drebbel was in financial trouble.</li>
						<li><strong>1633</strong> Towards the end of his life Drebbel was involved in a plan to drain the Fens around Cambridge, while living in near-poverty running an ale house in England. He died in London.</li>
